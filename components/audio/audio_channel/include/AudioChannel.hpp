/**
 * @brief Per-channel audio state: WAV file streaming, ring buffer, volume ramping, and loop control.
 *
 * Each AudioChannel manages its own ring buffer filled by a reader task, and provides
 * sample-by-sample extraction for the mixer. Supports seamless looping and anti-click
 * volume ramping for dynamic crossfading compatibility.
 *
 * Ownership model: an atomic lifecycle state decides which task owns the file handle and
 * the write side of the ring buffer at any time.
 *
 * | State      | Owner of the file and ring write side        | Mixed            | Refilled |
 * |:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|:-----------------|:---------|
 * | `Idle`     | nobody                                       | no               | no       |
 * | `Loading`  | the task that won claim() and calls load()   | no               | no       |
 * | `Ready`    | the reader task matching isMemoryBacked()    | no               | yes      |
 * | `Active`   | owning reader                                | yes              | yes      |
 * | `Stopping` | owning reader                                | yes, fading to 0 | yes      |
 * | `Closing`  | owning reader, which closes and resets it    | no               | no       |
 *
 * Transitions: claim() Idle → Loading; load() Loading → Ready (or back to Idle on failure);
 * start() Ready → Active; requestStop() Active → Stopping or Ready → Closing; endMixCycle()
 * Stopping → Closing once the fade ends or the ring runs dry, and Active → Closing when a
 * one-shot played to its end; closeIfClosing() Closing → Idle. Every transition is a CAS or a
 * release store, and every state read is an acquire load, so the new owner sees the fields its
 * predecessor wrote.
 *
 * Ring geometry (see RingGeometry): N is a power of two from 2048 to 65536 samples, fixed by
 * allocateRing(). The reader refills below N/2 in reads of at most N/4 samples; load() prefills
 * N/4 samples from an SD file and N - 1 (the whole ring) from a memory-backed file.
 *
 * Thread safety model (the state decides who may call what):
 * - allocateRing(): once, before any other task can reach the channel (AudioEngine::init()).
 * - claim() / load(): caller task (only the task that won claim() may call load()).
 * - requestStop() / setTargetVolume(): any task, lock-free.
 * - arm() / disarm(): the task that runs AudioEngine::startGroup().
 * - start() / setGroup() / beginMixCycle() / mix*() / getNextSample() / endMixCycle(): mixer task only.
 * - isOwnedBy() / needsRefill() / refillBuffer() / closeIfClosing(): reader tasks only.
 * - state() / isActive() / underruns() / readFailures() / startCycle() / group() / dataSize() /
 *   hasOpenFile(): any task.
